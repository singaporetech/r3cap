# R3CAP: Real-Time 3D Reconstruction & Collaborative Authoring Platform

## Introduction

Previously known as demoConstruct, R3CAP is an open-source platform that enables accessible and collaborative scene authoring, powered by progressive 3D reconstruction. The project aims to democratize the construction of digital twin environments by providing an accessible platform that allows different users to populate, edit and interact with shared 3D digital replicas, all at the same time.

Designed to accommodate both professionals and untrained users, the experience is delivered through interfaces that run on common consumer devices.

R3CAP’s progressive 3D reconstruction approach enables near real-time 3D reconstruction which supports simultaneous parallel operations across diverse user roles:
1. scene capturing and digitization using a mobile camera,
2. scene editing on a desktop PC, and
3. scene exploration and inspection on a VR headset.

This platform powers many different use cases of digital twins and one of our current focus is in the healthcare sector, where we are working with Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Singapore.
